# Bionic Reader Extension

## Description

A new concept called Bionic Reading aims to increase readability of text for humans.

This extension converts text on-the-fly into Bionic Text. The goal of this extension is partly to measure and adapt the techniques around this, probably on an individual basis, because the original author of this plugin believes that the value of this technique is highly dependent upon a number of factors which must increase legibility of text.
